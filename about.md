I recently defended my PhD in Statistics and am now a postdoctoral researcher at **UW–Madison**.
I build optimizers that are both _theoretically grounded_ and _practical at scale_.

## Research Interests
- Deep Learning Optimization
- Curvature‑Aware Preconditioning
- Zeroth‑Order Optimization for LLMs
- Large‑Scale Gaussian Processes
