I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Statistics at the 
[University of Wisconsin–Madison](https://stat.wisc.edu/), working with 
Professor [Matthias Katzfuss](https://sites.google.com/view/katzfuss/home?authuser=0).

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the [University of Georgia](https://stat.uga.edu/) in 2025, co-advised by 
[Jaewoo Lee](https://www.ai.uga.edu/directory/people/jaewoo-lee) and [Yuan Ke](https://yuan-ke.github.io/). 
Before that, I completed my M.A. and B.A. in Applied Statistics at [Yonsei University](https://devcms.yonsei.ac.kr/stat_en/index.do).

My research focuses on deep learning optimization and Bayesian optimization, with an emphasis on curvature-aware 
gradient methods for large-scale models.
