# GitHub Pages Starter (Markdown only, no HTML)

This repo is a minimal personal site using **GitHub Pages + Jekyll (minima theme)**.
You edit **Markdown** files only — no HTML required.

## Quick Start
1. Create a repo named **`<your-username>.github.io`** on GitHub (replace with your username).
2. Upload all files from this starter to the repo root and commit.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**. For a user site, GitHub will auto‑publish from the `main` branch.
4. Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io` after 1–2 minutes.

## Customize
- In `_config.yml`, set `url` and replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.
- Edit `index.md`, `about.md`, `publications.md`, `projects.md`, and `cv.md` in Markdown.
- Put your CV PDF at `assets/cv/Hyunseok_Seung_CV.pdf`.

## Blogging (optional)
Add Markdown posts inside `_posts/` using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. They’ll appear on the home page automatically.

## Notes
- The **minima** theme is supported natively on GitHub Pages, so no workflow is required.
- If your repo isn’t the special name `<username>.github.io`, then enable Pages with: Settings → Pages → Build from branch.
